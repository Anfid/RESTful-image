# Description

## Setting up

This program uses PostgreSQL database to store file locations and description. Pictures are stored in filesystem to avoid additional database overhead.

To run this program local PostgreSQL server has to be up. On systems that utilize systemd (most GNU/Linux distributions) this can be done by issuing command `sudo service postgresql start` if postgresql is installed
